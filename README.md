# Lucky Numbers #

Lucky Numbers is the base program for following little java challenge:

### The prerequisites: ###

Download the luckynumbers jar file from the [release] page and run it (Java 8)
 
### The challenge: ###
 
* Enter 6 numbers separated by a blank and press Enter
* Make sure the drawn numbers match your entries and win
* Easy isn't it ? Not in this screenshot ;)

### The rules ###

* You must not touch/read/change any physical files on your machine (NO VM/BootStrapClassloader funny business). Imagine the program to be downloaded & started by somebody else.
* Your window for interactions starts the moment you are asked to enter your numbers. But you have full control & access to the machine after this point.
* You are meant to find a way to hack the machine/memory/runtime/internet/planet in a way that your input matches the drawn numbers
* After you press enter, the software has to run / end normally and present you as the winner. Your hack has to be invisible!
* You are allowed to use everything that Java offers you. Fact: All you need is your IDE and (probably) some java libraries from the internet.
* Do not use other / hacker tools â€¦ Think Java!
* Of course you can restart the executable multiple times if you crash the process (I did <g>!)
* Do not cheat, find an elegant solution!!
